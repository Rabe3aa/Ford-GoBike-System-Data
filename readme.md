## by Abdelrahman Ali Ali Mohamed


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

> Average Trips Times
> Average Bike ride monthly
> Average trips by gender


## Key Insights for Presentation

> We started my analysis by looking at the structure of the dataset.The main area of interest was what are the factors influencing the trip duration.

> Data wrangling for this dataset consisted of converting the data files, combining the monthes worth of datasets into 1 annual dataset and dropping several of the unnecessary columns that would not be used in the data analysis.

> In the exploration, We have three major parts which it is Univariate Exploration, Bivariate Exploration and Multivariate Exploration.
### Univariate Exploration
> We have calculate the average bike trips and found that : the average is between 1 to 100 mins.
> Also we get the max bike ride trips month which it is : The maximum bike rides are in month 9 (sep)

### Bivariate Exploration
invastigating the relationship between average bike ride time and months
> We have calculate the ride bike duration for each month and the values is larger than 200 mins in each month. Aug and Sep had the longest trips.
> Also categorize the 4 seasons and get which season take more bike rides and it was the fall season.
> We calculate the member gender rider counts and it was 12 million for male and 400,000 for female riders.

### Mulvariate Exploration
invastigating relationship between month, trip lenght and the days
> We the relations between the three factors and it was that in 2, 8 and 12 month(s) show a spike in the time spent on bike.
another invastigation that the relationship between month, trip lenght and gender
> Females have more trips on the whole than male users. Although male users have generally longer journey durations, above 400 minutes.
